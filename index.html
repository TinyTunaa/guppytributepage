      <h2 id="headline">About Guppy</h2>
      <p>Guppy, Isaac's beloved feline companion, holds a special place in the heart of those who venture into the
        mysterious world beneath the trapdoor. Though the details of Guppy's life are shrouded in mystery, we know that
        his presence continues to resonate with Isaac throughout his perilous journey. Now, in the labyrinthine depths
        beneath the trapdoor, Guppy's presence is felt not only in the tender memories shared with Isaac but also
        through the remnants of himself he left behind to aid his companion on his journey.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Guppy's Tail</strong>, discovered amidst the shadows within the Devil Room, Curse Room, or Red
          Chests,
          bestows upon one's journey the blessing of transforming chests. Once acquired, it grants a 1 in 3 chance to
          replace
          any mundane pick-up with something far more valuable, offering Isaac a glimmer of hope amidst the encroaching
          darkness.</li>

        <li><strong>Guppy's Head</strong>, a cherished relic found among the scattered remnants of Isaac's world,
          summoned forth a legion of loyal Attack Flies. In their buzzing embrace, Isaac found solace and strength,
          their relentless defense echoing the unwavering loyalty of his feline friend.</li>

        <li><strong>Guppy's Paw</strong>, a beacon of resilience amidst the chaos, transformed the very essence of
          Isaac's being. Upon activation, one heart turns into three Soul Hearts, a testament to Guppy's enduring spirit
          and
          the boundless love that sustained them through the trials ahead.</li>

        <li>And who could forget <strong>Guppy's Hair Ball</strong>, a whimsical companion trailing faithfully behind
          Isaac, a reminder of the playful antics shared between boy and cat? As Isaac spun in a circle, the hairball
          could be wielded like a flail,
          dealing damage to enemies upon collision. With each foe vanquished, it grew in size and strength, making it
          easier to swing and more potent
          in battle, symbolizing the ever-growing bond between Isaac and Guppy."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the quiet moments of reflection, amidst the chaos of Isaac's journey, these artifacts serve as a testament
        to the enduring legacy of Guppy. Though he may have departed this world, his spirit lives on in the treasures he
        left behind, guiding Isaac through the darkness with the warmth of his memory.

        <p>
          "Guppy wasn't just a cat; he was my courage, my comfort, my everything. Even now, his presence guides me
          through the darkness."
